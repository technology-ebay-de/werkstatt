# werkstatt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/technology-ebay-de/werkstatt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/technology-ebay-de/werkstatt)

Like Wordpress, but for coding.

## Rationale

Coding is a powerful way in the digital age to get a computer doing what you want. But not everyone is a software engineer and is used to the ugly tools required to do coding nowadays.

Wordpress allows everyone to write and publish content on the internet, without writing HTML all the time. Werkstatt does the same for coding. You do not need to learn Git or use a command line. Just code!

By giving coding a typical usability many people are used to, we can enable more people to code. This is an important step to push coding literacy in our companys and our society.

## Usage

Currently werkstatt is a UI prototype and not fully usable. But we are working on it ðŸ˜‰.

If you want to try out the prototype, follow the istructions in [web/README.md](web/README.md#usage).
