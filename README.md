# werkstatt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/technology-ebay-de/werkstatt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/technology-ebay-de/werkstatt)

Like WordPress, but for coding.

## Rationale

Coding is a powerful way to get a computer to do what you want. But not everyone is a software engineer, or willing to tolerate the ugly tools that are often used for coding.

WordPress allows everyone to write and publish content on the internet, without writing HTML all the time. Werkstatt does the same for coding. You donâ€™t need to learn Git or use a command line. Just code!

By improving coding usability, we can enable more people to code. This is an important step to promote coding literacy in our companies and our society.

## Usage

Currently werkstatt is a UI prototype and not fully usable. But we are working on it ðŸ˜‰.

To try out the prototype, follow the instructions in [web/README.md](web/README.md#usage).
